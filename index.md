## About Me

Hi, I’m Hud, a security engineer turned data analyst passionate about solving complex cybersecurity challenges with the power of data. Over the past decade, I’ve built a dynamic career that bridges hands-on technical expertise and strategic advisory roles across global teams and mission-critical environments.

Currently, I’m part of the [Upanzi Network Lab](https://www.africa.engineering.cmu.edu/research/upanzi/index.html) at Carnegie Mellon University’s [Cybersecurity lab (CyLab)](https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/), where I lead the development of smart, automated Security Operations Centers (SOCs). My work integrates big data, machine learning, and LLM-based assistants to enhance threat detection, streamline alert triage, and reduce incident response times.

I’ve led security assessments for critical infrastructure, secured 5G and IIoT environments, and advised on cybersecurity policy in sectors like healthcare, digital identity, and payments. Whether I’m building tools, tuning SIEMs, running simulations, or training the next generation of analysts, my goal is always the same: create resilient systems and empower people to protect them.

With strong communication skills, I bridge gaps between technical and non-technical teams, helping organizations turn insights into action. I thrive in both startup and enterprise environments and bring a calm, focused energy to high-stakes situations.

I'm currently based in Washington, USA and open to exciting opportunities at the intersection of cybersecurity, data science, and digital transformation.

I am a security engineer turned data analyst with a passion for leveraging exploratory and explanatory data analysis to help organizations swiftly detect threats and anomalies within their infrastructure. Currently, I am part of a team developing a smart, automated intrusion detection system that utilizes big data and machine learning concepts to enhance threat detection capabilities. Additionally, I collaborate with a team of security engineers to deliver complex security services, including threat hunting, log monitoring, vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, compliance, operational risk assessments, and managing stakeholder relationships.

One of my key strengths is my ability to effectively communicate with both technical and non-technical personnel, simplifying complex concepts for broader understanding. I excel at identifying and addressing communication gaps, enhancing overall information flow. My diverse experience spans various organizational settings, from large corporations to startup environments, across both private and public sectors. I am loyal, trustworthy, and excel in crisis situations. I am currently open to new opportunities in data science and cybersecurity.
