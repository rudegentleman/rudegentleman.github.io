I am a Security Engineer currently working with [Tabiri Analytics, Inc.](https://tabirianalytics.com/), a start up providing affordable cyber security monitoring for underserved markets mainly within sub-saharan Africa. Located in Kigali, Rwanda, we work with in-house IT Staff as an extension to their IT team with a focus of continously monitoring system for cyber threats. We are utilising open source tools to build a smart, automated intrusion detection system that encompasses the use of machine learning concepts to detect anomalies in systems. As a security lead, I work with a team of security engineers to deliver complex security services like continous monitoring, vulnerability assessments and penetration testing, compliance and risk assessments as well as engage and manage stakeholder relationships.  

## Current Interests and Projects:
