excerpt: "About Me..."
---

I am a security engineer turned data analyst who loves using exploratory and explanatory data analysis tools and techniques to help organizations quickly detect threats and anomalies on their infrastructure. Right now, I am part of a team that is designing and building a smart automated intrusion detection system that encompasses the use of big data and machine learning concepts to detect threats and anomalies in systems. I also work with a team of security engineers to deliver complex security services like threat hunting, log monitoring, vulnerability assessments and penetration testing, compliance, operational and risk assessments as well as manage stakeholder relationships. 

One of my greatest strengths is my ability to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical personnel. I am able to explain complex concepts in simple terms that anyone can understand. I am also very good at identifying areas where communication is lacking and improving it. Also, I have worked in a myriad of different organizational settings both in private and public sectors, ranging from big corporations to most recently in a start-up setting. I am loyal. I am trustworthy and I am good in a crisis. I am open to new opportunities in the areas of Data Science and Cybersecurity.

I am currently working with [Tabiri Analytics, Inc.](https://tabirianalytics.com/), a start up providing affordable cyber security monitoring for underserved markets mainly within sub-saharan Africa. We are located in the beautiful city of a thousand hills; Kigali, Rwanda.
